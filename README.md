# Dr Aid
### A web app for collection and management of patient clinical information

Dr. Aid is a software that will collect and update clinical information on a patient, including symptoms, diagnoses, treatments and any other useful information.  The software will be accessible to all doctors working with an individual patient so that they may communicate their findings, suspicions, and efforts in a fast and effective way.  The software will also have filtering capabilities so that doctors might find patients with similar conditions to see what has been tried and what has been effective.  They will also be able to contact the medical professionals that have worked with patients similar to theirs to discuss the case.  The software should organize a patientâ€™s information clearly and concisely, otherwise medical professionals will be less likely to use it.  It must also be easily accessible and able to run on Apple and Android products in addition to PCs and Macs, as many doctors offices are moving toward using tablets and notebooks as opposed to standard desktop computers.
